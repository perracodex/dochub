# Secure URLs

[Secure URLs](../dochub-core/base/src/main/kotlin/dochub/base/security/util/SecureUrl.kt) are used to provide encrypted URLs helping to obscure actual resources,
such as the file storage locations, ensuring also that they expire after a predefined duration.

### URL Composition
- **Base URL**: The starting point to which the token and signature are appended.
- **Token**: An encrypted string that includes user data, such as a document id, and an expiration timestamp, formatted as "data:expiration".
- **Signature**: A cryptographic hash generated using HMAC to verify the integrity of the URL.

### Detailed Token and URL Format
- **Data**: `e35814b6-d459-4c9a-8e4a-2f0755e09ea0` (the id of a concrete document)
- **Expiration**: `1700839395` (UNIX timestamp format)
- **Plain Token**: `e35814b6-d459-4c9a-8e4a-2f0755e09ea0:1700839395` (concatenation of data and expiration timestamp)
- **Encrypted Token**: Encrypted and Base64 encoded version of the plain token.
- **Signature**: Base64 encoded HMAC of the URL containing the token.

#### Output Example URL
```console
https://example.com/endpoint?token=EncryptedBase64Token&signature=EncodedSignature
```

### Potential Enhancements

- Authorized actor ids could be included in the token to ensure that only the intended recipient can access the resource.
- The token could be extended to include additional data, such as document type or owner id, to provide more context.
